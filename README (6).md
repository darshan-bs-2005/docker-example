# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

A web-based machine learning application that predicts fraudulent credit card transactions using multiple trained classification models on real-world transaction data

🔗 **Live Demo**: [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Trashika112/Credit-card-fraud-app)

---

## 🚀 Models Trained

We trained and evaluated the following models:

- ✅ **Random Forest Classifier** *(Best Performance)*
- ✅ **Logistic Regression**
- ✅ **Decision Tree Classifier**

Each model was evaluated using:
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)**
- **ROC-AUC Score**
- **Visualization of ROC Curves**

---

## 📊 Best Model: Random Forest

- **Accuracy**: ~99.9%
- **Precision (fraud)**: 96%
- **Recall (fraud)**: 27%
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.94+

## 📁 Dataset Used

- `fraudTrain.csv`  
- `fraudTest.csv`  
- Source: [Kaggle]

---

## 🧠 How the App Works

1. Input transaction details using the interface
2. The app uses the **Random Forest** model to:
   - Predict whether it's **Fraud** or **Not Fraud**
   - Show the **probability score** of fraud
3. Output is displayed in a clear text format
